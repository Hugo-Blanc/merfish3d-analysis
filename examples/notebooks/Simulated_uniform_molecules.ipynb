        "# Test `merfish3d-analysis` on simulation MERFISH data\n",
        "The goal of this notebook is to show the performance of [`merfish3d-analysis`](https://github.com/QI2lab/merfish3d-analysis) on simulated data. The output metric is the [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) that determines how well `merfish3d-analysis` discovers the RNA molecules used to generate the simulation. We will use a single FOV with uniformly distribured RNA molecules. **Note:** `merfish3d-analysis` requires a GPU runtime and will not run without one.\n"
