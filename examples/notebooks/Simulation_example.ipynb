        "The goal of this notebook is to show the performance of [`merfish3d-analysis`](https://github.com/QI2lab/merfish3d-analysis) on simulated MERFISH data. The output metric is the [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) that determines how well `merfish3d-analysis` recovers the ground truth location and identity of the RNA molecules used to generate the simulation. We will use a single FOV with uniformly distributed RNA molecules. **Note:** `merfish3d-analysis` requires a GPU runtime and will not run without one."

The individual RNA molecules are imaged using a 16-bit Hamming Weight 4 Distance 4 codebook and a simulated microscope with realistic parameters and noise. The imaging simulation is performed in 8 rounds each with 3 channels, containg 2 MERFISH bits per round and a fidicual marker. Three simulations of the same RNA molecules are performed for three different axial steps sizes (0.315 ùúám, 1.0 ùúám, 1.5 ùúám) to explore the impact of sufficent axial sampling when imaging."
